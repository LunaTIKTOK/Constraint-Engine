# Claim-Verify

Claim-Verify is a pre-execution risk engine for humans and AI agents.

It takes any claim, task, or proposed action, estimates its reliability and the likely cost of being wrong, and decides whether execution should proceed, proceed with warning, or require human approval.

This is not a fact-checker and not a generic safety wrapper. Claim-Verify is a control layer that prices uncertainty before action.

Its purpose is simple:
- reduce decision error
- reduce wasted compute
- block structurally invalid or high-risk actions
- escalate structurally invalid or high-risk actions to a human when needed
